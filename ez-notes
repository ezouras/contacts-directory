# WebApp

## To Do:

The goal of this coding challenge is to build a simple
front-end directory application using Angular.
The requirements for this application are as follows:

- A list of contact previews sorted alphabetically by last name.
Each contact preview should contain the first and last name of
the contact, as well as their phone number if available

- A search bar that takes user input and filters the
contact list via first or last name
- When a contact is selected from the list (via a mouse click),
the contact details should display on the screen with all
the information available
- Make functional add, edit, and delete contact buttons.
The changes made via these buttons do not need to survive
refreshing the application
- BONUS: Make the contact data persistent i.e. edits
survive refresh and application rebuilds

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Other Notes

- The functionality of the application is the
most important part, but some use of CSS to
make a nice looking UI is encouraged
- Boilerplate has been provided and the entire
application can be built within the provided app
component, but feel free to create new files and
organize your code as you see fit
- You are allowed to use third party libraries,
but be prepared to justify any choices made in this area
- Unit tests are optional
- Any questions please feel free to reach out

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma]
(https://karma-runner.github.io).
